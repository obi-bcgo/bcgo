# Beta Cell Genomics Ontology (BCGO)

Beta Cell Genomics Ontology (BCGO) is an application ontology built for the Beta Cell Genomics database (http://genomics.betacell.org/gbco/) aiming to support database annotation, complicated semantic queries, and automated cell type classification. The ontology is developed using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as upper ontology, Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) as ontology framework and integrated subsets of multiple OBO Foundry (candidate) ontologies. Current the BCGO contains 2270 classes including terms referencing to over 20 various OBO Foundry ontologies including BFO 2.0 classes only, OBI, IAO, UBERON, CL, CLO, etc..

The ontology is available on: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bcgo.owl

Recommended Protege version and Reasoner are Protege 5 and Hermit 1.3.8.
